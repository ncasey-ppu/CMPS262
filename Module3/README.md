# Classic Movie API
The API uses PostgreSQL to create a server and database to track my favorite classic movies. This project is for learning purposes. 

## Installation & Setup
This project required Node.js, Express, PostrgreSQL, Postman, and was finally deployed to Render as the last step. 
PostgreSQL and Postman were downloaded off the internet. We used Node.js in a previouse assignment, so this was already installed. 
Express, nodemon and cors needed to be installed with the below code
```
npm i express
npm i nodemon
npm install cors
```
